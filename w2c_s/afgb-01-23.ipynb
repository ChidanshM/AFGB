What is the result of the code, and why?\n","```py\n","def func(a, b=6, c=8):\n","\tprint(a, b, c)\n","func(1, 2)\n","```\n","**output:**\n","```\n","1 2 8\n","```\n","> **Explanation**:  the function `func()` is called with arguments `1` and `2` assigned to `a` and `b`, thus for `c` the default value is used.\n","---\n","\n","\n","### 2. What is the result of this code, and why?\n","```py\n","def func(a, b, c=5):\n","\tprint(a, b, c)\n","func(1, c=3, b=2)\n","```\n","**output:**\n","```\n","1 2 3\n","```\n","> **Explanation**:  in the `func()` call values to arguments `c` and `b` are passed explicitly that's why the order of arguments isn't necessary, whereas `1` is passed and assigned to `a`\n","---\n","\n","\n","### 3. How about this code: what is its result, and why?\n","```py\n","def func(a, *pargs):\n","\tprint(a, pargs)\n","func(1, 2, 3)\n","```\n","**output:**\n","```\n","1 (2,3)\n","```\n","> **Explanation**: the `*pargs`is used to pass a non-keyworded variable length argument list to the function `func()` which then takes this list into a tuple. So during `func()` call `1` is assigned to `a` as it takes only a single value, then `2` and `3` assigned to `*pargs`\n","---\n","\n","\n","### 4. What does this code print, and why?\n","```py\n","def func(a, **kargs):\n","\tprint(a, kargs)\n","func(a=1, c=3, b=2)\n","```\n","**output:**\n","```\n","1 {'c': 3, 'b': 2}\n","```\n","> **Explanation**:  the `*pargs` parameter is used to pass keyworded variable length of arguments to the function, creating a dictionary. So, when `func(a=1, c=3, b=2)` is called, `a` is assigned `1`, and `kargs` is assigned `{'c': 3, 'b': 2}`.\n","---\n","\n","\n","### 5. What gets printed by this, and explain?\n","```py \n","def func(a, b, c=8, d=5): \n","\tprint(a, b, c, d)\n","func(1, *(5, 6))\n","```\n","**output:**\n","```\n","1 5 6 5\n","```\n","> **Explanation**: The `*` is an unpacking operator that unpacks the tuple `(5, 6)` into positional arguments. So, the call `func(1, *(5, 6))` is equivalent to `func(1, 5, 6)`, and the function prints `1 5 6 5.\n","---\n","\n","\n","### 6. what is the result of this, and explain?\n","```py\n","def func(a, b, c): a = 2; b[0] = 'x'; c['a'] = 'y'\n","\n","l=1; m=[1]; n={'a':0}\n","func(l, m, n)\n","l, m, n\n","```\n","**output:**\n","```\n","(1, ['x'], {'a': 'y'})\n","```\n","> **Explanation**:  During `func()` call `l`, `m`, and `n` are passed as arguments. Inside `func()`, `a` is assigned the value `2`, the first element of list `b` is changed to `'x'`, and the value associated with key `'a'` in dictionary `c` is changed to `'y'`. Since lists and dictionaries are mutable, the changes made to `m` and `n` are reflected outside the function. Hence, after calling `func()`, `l` remains `1`, `m` becomes `['x']`, and `n` becomes `{'a': 'y'}`."]}],"metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3","name": "python3"},"language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython","version": 3},"file_extension": ".py","mimetype": "text/x-python","name": "python","nbconvert_exporter": "python","pygments_lexer": "ipython3","version": "3.9.18"}},"nbformat": 4,"nbformat_minor": 0}
