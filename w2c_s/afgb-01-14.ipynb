What does RGBA stand for?\n","RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. Colour model in which colours using a combination of intensity values of red, green, and blue, and an alpha channel for transparency.\n","___\n","\n","\n","### 2. From the `Pillow` module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?\n","`getpixel()` method of the `Image` object to get the RGBA value of a specific pixel\n","```python\n","from PIL import Image\n","img = Image.open('example.jpg')\n","rgba_value = img.getpixel((x, y)) #pixel at coordinates (x, y)\n","print(rgba_value)\n","```\n","___\n","\n","\n","### 3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n","A box tuple in Pillow is a tuple representing a rectangular region in an image. It consists of four integer values: (left, upper, right, lower), defining the respective coordinates edges. But the region includes the left and upper edges whereas excludes the right and lower edges.\n","___\n","\n","\n","### 4. Use your image and load in the notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an `Image` object?\n","Use the `size` attribute of the `Image` object to find out its width and height.\n","```python\n","from PIL import Image\n","img = Image.open('example.jpg')\n","width, height = img.size\n","print(f\"Width: {width}, Height: {height}\")\n","```\n","___\n","\n","\n","### 5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?\n","You can use the `crop()` method to get an Image object for a specified region. For example:\n","```python\n","# Crop the image to exclude the lower-left quarter\n","new_img = img.crop((0, 0, width // 2, height // 2))\n","```\n","___\n","\n","\n","### 6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?\n","`save()` method\n","```python\n","new_img.save('modified_example.jpg')\n","```\n","___\n","\n","\n","### 7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?\n","`ImageDraw` module, to draw various shapes (lines, rectangles, circles, etc.) on an image.\n","___\n","\n","\n","### 8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?\n","The `ImageDraw.Draw` object has drawing methods. You can obtain an `ImageDraw.Draw` object by calling the `ImageDraw.Draw()` function, passing in the Image object you want to draw on.\n","```python\n","from PIL import Image, ImageDraw\n","img = Image.open('example.jpg')\n","draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img) # Now you can use drawing methods on the draw object\n","```\n"]}],"metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3","name": "python3"},"language_info": {"name": "python"}},"nbformat": 4,"nbformat_minor": 0}
