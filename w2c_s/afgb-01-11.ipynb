				"\n",

				"### 2. Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain strings that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different (that is, 'hello' and 'hello' are considered the same, and 'goodbye' and 'GOODbye' are also considered the same).\n",

				"- Logging messages can be easily disabled or enabled based on the logging level.\n",
				"- Logging messages can be redirected to different outputs, such as files.\n",
				"- Logging messages can be categorised \n",

				"### 9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
				"- **Step Over:** Executes the current line of code and stops at the next line. If the next line is a function call, it won't go into the function.\n",
				"- **Step In:** Executes the current line of code and stops at the first line of any function that is called.\n",
				"- **Step Out:** Continues execution until the current function returns.\n",

				"### 10. After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop ?\n",
				"The debugger will stop when it encounters a breakpoint, an exception is raised, or the program completes.\n",
				"___\n",
				"\n",
				"\n",
				"### 11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
				"A breakpoint is a specified point in the code where the debugger will pause execution, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the program's state."
