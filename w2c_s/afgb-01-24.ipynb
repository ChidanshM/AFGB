What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n","- Both `def` statements and `lambda` expressions are used to create functions in Python.\n","- `def` statements are used to define named functions with a block of code which can contain multiple statements and have a return value. Generally they are preferred for more complex function. \n","- `lambda` expressions create anonymous functions (functions without a name) and are often used for conciseness operations, which are limited  to single expression. Generally they are used for simpler functions or as an arguments to higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`. \n","---\n","\n","\n","### 2. What is the benefit of lambda?\n","- The main benefit of `lambda` expressions is to create anonymous functions with conciseness operations\n","- They are often used as a temporary simple function or as an arguments to higher-order functions.\n","---\n","\n","\n","### 3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n","- `map()`: function applied to all items in an input iterable and returns a new iterable containing the results.\n","- `filter()`: Filters elements from an input iterable based on a given function (predicate) and returns a new iterable containing only the elements for which the function returns `True`.\n","- `reduce()`: function applied of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, to reduce the iterable to a single value.Take in note its a non-built-in function in Python 3 and must be imported from the `functools` module.\n","---\n","\n","\n","### 4. What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n","- An arbitrary metadata attached to function parameters and return values using the `->` syntax.\n","- Used to specify the expected types of function arguments and return values, but type checking not enforced.\n","- Purely optional and are mainly used for documentation purposes or by external tools.\n","- Example: `def add(x: int, y: int) -> int: return x + y`\n","---\n","\n","\n","### 5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n","- Functions that call themselves either directly or indirectly in order to solve a problem.\n","- Often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.\n","- They must have a base case to terminate the recursion, preventing infinite recursion.\n","- Example: Factorial function: `def factorial(n): return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n - 1)`\n","---\n","\n","\n","### 6. What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?\n","- Keep functions concise and focused on a single task (single responsibility principle).\n","- Meaningful names - functions and parameters - to reflect their purpose.\n","- Document functions - docstrings - explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.\n","- Write testable functions by separating logic from I/O operations.\n","- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and refactor repetitive code into reusable functions.\n","- Use function annotations for clarity, especially in larger codebases.\n","---\n","\n","\n","### 7. Name three or more ways that functions can communicate results to a caller.\n",">`return`, `print`, `yield`, Exception raising, Callback functions, Global variables, Data structures"]}],"metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3","name": "python3"},"language_info": {"name": "python"}},"nbformat": 4,"nbformat_minor": 0}
